ThinkPad Rotate
###############

This script is intended for the Lenovo ThinkPad X220 Tablet which features a
Wacom pen and touch screen. With this script, you can rotate the screen in
any direction you like and it will also rotate the pen and touch input.

Installation
============

Type::

    # make install

Usage
=====

By default, it will rotate to the left, since you can use the battery as a
nice handle then. If you invoke it without any arguments, it will rotate the
screen to the left or back to normal::

    rotate

And then later on::

    rotate

If you want to rotate it to other directions, you can specify the direction,
like so::

    rotate left
    rotate right
    rotate flip
    rotate normal
