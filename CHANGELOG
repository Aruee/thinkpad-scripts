v1.0
    This is the first release with a version number. It contains a couple fixes and
    improvements compared to previous (before 2012-07-13) versions of these
    scripts.

    - Accept other names for the rotation.
    - Disable the trackpad as well.
    - Start and stop the virtual keyboard.
    - Try to go back automatically, if a rotation is already set.
    - Use ``--rotation`` instead of ``-o``. This will only rotate the internal
      screen and not any attached screens as well.

Way before 2012-07-13, those are significant changes in the history:

    - Add desktop files.
    - Also set Wacom hardware correctly.
    - Determine resolution automatically.
    - Disable trackpoint when switching.
    - Dynamically find external display.
    - Limit Wacom devices to internal screen.
    - Set external monitor as primary.
