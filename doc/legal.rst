I took the script, that served as a basis for :doc:`/man/thinkpad-rotate.1` from
a forums entry where the original author said:

    “Put this in a file blah.sh anywhere, and do whatever you want with it!”

The changes that I made to that script are licensed under the GPLv2_.

The :doc:`/man/thinkpad-mutemic.1` script is taken almost verbatim from
[mutemic]_. That script is licensed under CC-BY-SA and the GPLv2_.

All other scripts are just licensed under GPLv2_.
